# Learn iOS9 Hybrid Apps using Swift and JavaScript/TypeScript
We think [Hybrid Apps](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/what-is-a-hybrid-mobile-app/) will take over the iOS 9 app landscape. Swift and JavaScript/[TypeScript](https://github.com/ziaukhan/learn-typescript) are a match made in heaven. We do not think that the main advantage of hybrid apps is just the cross platform nature of such apps, but increased functionality and productivity are main reason to develop these apps. Currently when developing hybrid apps the developers create most of the app in JavaScript/TypeScript and use Cordova plugins for native functionality. We recommend that the developers should use the best of the both worlds depending on the requirements. They should use Swift code where performance and native mobile functionality is required and use JavaScript/TypeScript where it can help in developing the best functionality in the least amount of time. For example if you want to develop a data driven component it may be more productive and maybe produce better results if you use JavaScript based [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).

You may ask why the hybrid solution was not a better choice before iOS 9. The issue was that in iOS 8 there was a [bug](http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/cordova-support-for-wkwebview-in-ios8/10480) which severely effected the usibility of hybrid apps. With the upcoming release of iOS 9 this issue has been [resolved](https://twitter.com/wkwebview/status/613448365456490496). Furthermore, iOS 9 also gives [additional options](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-and-safari-view-controller-the-future-of-web-views/).

In these tutorials we will learn to develop hybrid iOS 9 mobile apps using Swift and JavaScript/Typescript by taking small incremental steps.
